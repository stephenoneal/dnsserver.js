forked from https://github.com/sh1mmer/dnsserver.js

New purpose is to setup a service that sole purpose is to eat type 65 requests and return an rfc compliant non-forwarded response that doesn't
trigger subsequent requests.

TODO: cut down to functionally enough to blackhole the type 65 request
TODO: include instructions on the iptables match for shunting dns type 65 requests away from the intended dns port to a new port.
TODO: add more tests?
